.gitignore in Version Control

What is .gitignore?
.gitignore is a special file in a Git repository that tells Git which 
files and directories to ignore. This means that the files listed in 
.gitignore will not be tracked by Git, and any changes to them will not be 
staged, committed, or pushed to a remote repository.

Why is .gitignore Important?

Excluding Unnecessary Files:
Projects often contain files that are not relevant to the codebase, such
 as temporary files, logs, build artifacts, or compiled code. By ignoring 
 these files, the repository stays clean and free of clutter.

Protecting Sensitive Information:
Some files might contain sensitive information like passwords, API keys, 
or configuration details. Adding these to .gitignore ensures they are not 
accidentally shared or exposed in a public repository.

Improving Performance:
Ignoring large files or directories that do not need to be 
version-controlled can improve the performance of Git operations. 
This keeps the repository size manageable and speeds up actions like 
cloning or checking out branches.

Maintaining Consistency Across Environments:
Developers may use different operating systems or development environments, 
which generate different types of temporary or configuration files. The 
.gitignore file helps ensure that these environment-specific files do not 
interfere with the repository.

Example of a .gitignore File

node_modules/

# Ignore log files
*.log

# Ignore compiled files
*.class
*.o

# Ignore sensitive files
config.json

# Ignore OS-specific files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
