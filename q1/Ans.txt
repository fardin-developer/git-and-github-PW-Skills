Version control is a system that helps track changes made to files
over time. It records every modification to the code, allowing developers to:

1. Save Progress: Capture the state of their work at various points, creating a history of changes.

2. Collaborate: Work together on the same project without overwriting each other's changes. 
Multiple developers can work on the same files simultaneously, merging their changes seamlessly.

3. Undo Mistakes: Revert to a previous version if something goes wrong or if they need to undo changes.

4. Experiment Safely: Try out new ideas in separate branches without affecting the main project. 
If the experiment works, it can be merged back; if not, it can be discarded without any impact.

5. Track History: Understand who made which changes and why, providing accountability and context for
 future reference.

Importance in Software Development
1. Collaboration: Facilitates teamwork by allowing multiple people to work on different parts of a
 project simultaneously without conflicts.
2. Backup: Provides a safety net. If something breaks, you can always revert to a previous, 
stable version.
3. Documentation: Each change can include a message explaining why it was made, helping everyone
 understand the projectâ€™s evolution.
4. Efficiency: Makes it easier to manage and integrate contributions from different team members, 
speeding up development.
5. Quality: By experimenting and rolling back changes easily, developers can maintain higher
 quality and stability in their projects.
