Contributing to an Open-Source Project on GitHub: Step-by-Step

1.Find a Project:
We start by browsing GitHub to find an open-source project that interests us. 
We should look for repositories with active maintainers and clear 
contribution guidelines.

2.Fork the Repository:
we click the "Fork" button on the repository's page to create our own 
copy of the repository under our GitHub account or in other platform 
where the project is available.

3. Clone Our Fork:
We then clone the forked repository to our local machine.

4.Create a Branch:
After navigating to the repository directory, we create a new branch for 
our work. In github we use command : git checkout -b ourBranchName

5.Make Changes:
Now, we make our changes or add new features to the project. 
We should ensure our changes align with the project's coding standards 
and contribution guidelines.

6.Commit Our Changes:
We stage the changes we made and commit them with a descriptive message:
git add .
git commit -m "Description of changes"

7.Push Our Branch:
We push the changes to our forked repository on GitHub:
git push origin ourBranchName

8.Create a Pull Request:
Next, we go to the original repository on GitHub. We will see a prompt 
 to create a pull request. Click on "Compare & pull request".

We provide a clear title and description of our changes, and then submit 
 the pull request.

9.Collaborate and Respond:
We maintain open communication with the project maintainers, addressing any 
 feedback or requested changes in a timely manner.
We update our pull request by making changes locally, committing them, 
 and pushing to our branch. The pull request will automatically update.

10. Merge
Once our pull request is approved, it will be merged into the main project.
