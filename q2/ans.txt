Git Workflow Explanation

1. Working Directory
The working directory is the area where all the files and directories
of a project are located. This is where developers make changes to 
their project files. Any modifications, additions, or deletions of
files occur in the working directory.

2. Staging Area (Index)
The staging area, also known as the index, is an intermediate area
where changes are collected before they are committed to the repository.
When a file is modified in the working directory and is ready to
be included in the next commit, it is added to the staging area.
This allows developers to prepare a set of changes as a single unit,
which can be committed together.

3. Repository
The repository is where Git stores all the committed changes and the history 
of the project. It contains all the versions of the project's files, which 
are stored in a compressed format. The repository can be local (on the 
developer's machine) or remote (on a server). The repository maintains 
the complete history of the project, allowing developers to revert to 
previous versions if necessary.

Git Workflow Steps
Modify Files in the Working Directory:
Developers make changes to files in the working directory.

Stage Changes:
Using the git add command, developers add the changes from the working 
directory to the staging area.

Commit Changes:
Using the git commit command, the staged changes are committed to the 
repository. This creates a new snapshot of the project at that point in time.

Push to Remote Repository (if applicable):
Using the git push command, the committed changes are pushed to a remote 
repository to share with other collaborators.

This workflow ensures that changes are systematically controlled and recorded, 
providing a reliable history of the projectâ€™s evolution.
